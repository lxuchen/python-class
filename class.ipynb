    "**Purpose of encapsulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: The __validate_pin method is an internal helper used only inside the BankAccount class to check a PIN. It keeps implementation details out of the public API (get_balance, deposit, etc.).\n",
    "- **Prevent accidental access/override**: The double-underscore name signals the method is private and Python performs name-mangling to reduce accidental external access and collisions in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the code shows**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In your BankAccount class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def __validate_pin(self, pin): \n",
    "    return pin == self.__pin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods (e.g., get_balance) should call it as `self.__validate_pin(pin)` to decide whether to return the balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name mangling** (how Python implements \"private\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- A method named `__validate_pin` inside `BankAccount` is internally stored as `_BankAccount__validate_pin`.\n",
    "- This means direct external calls like `my_account.__validate_pin(\"1234\")` raise AttributeError.\n",
    "- You can still access it externally as `my_account._BankAccount__validate_pin(\"1234\")`, but this is discouraged (breaks encapsulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use it** (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call it from other class methods via `self.__validate_pin(pin)`:\n",
    "- From outside the class, use the public API:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single underscore vs double underscore**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a single leading underscore `(_helper)` to indicate a \"protected\"/internal method by convention (subclasses can still access it).\n",
    "- Use double leading underscores `(__helper)` when you need to avoid name collisions in subclasses or want stronger \"privacy\" via name-mangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When not to use double-underscore**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If subclasses need to override or call the helper, prefer a single underscore.\n",
    "- If you only want a convention-based internal method (not enforced), use _validate_pin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test behavior through public methods (get_balance, deposit) rather than calling __validate_pin directly.\n",
    "- If necessary in tests, you can access the mangled name instance._ClassName__method, but prefer testing via the public API.\n"
